- 👋 Hi, I’m @lchan-ochca
- 👀 I’m interested (sometimes a _bit_ obsessed) with organizational behavior and health psychology research. I'm an applied researcher by day @ County of Orange, Health Care Agency, and lecturer of management, psych, and stats by night @ Cal Poly Pomona and Chapman University.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create smarter, more responsible, scalable AI and enterprise data management solutions. As an educator, I'm learning how to better teach data science foundations for all types of students, including psych and management students. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on general database integration and related Git workflows, and statistics code primarily as it relates to the social sciences.
