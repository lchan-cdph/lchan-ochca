- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lchan-ochca
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in organizational behavior and health psychology research. I'm an applied researcher @ the County of Orange, Health Care Agency - Department of Behavioral Health Services, and Lecturer of Management, Psychology, and Statistics @ Cal Poly Pomona and Chapman University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on advancing data science initiatives and analyses at a local and system-wide level. As an educator, I'm always learning how to better teach data science and statistics foundations for all types of students, namely psychology and management students.
