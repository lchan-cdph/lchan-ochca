- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lchan-ochca
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in organizational behavior and health psychology research. I'm an applied researcher / data scientist @ the County of Orange, Health Care Agency, and University Lecturer of Management, Social Sciences, and Statistics @ California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, and Chapman University in Southern California.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on advancing data science initiatives and analyses at a local and system-wide level. As an educator, I'm always learning how to better teach data science and statistics foundations for all types of students, namely psychology and management students.
